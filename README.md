# Hedge Fund Portfolio Optimization: A Semi-Parametric Approach

This repository contains the code and related files developed for my Master's thesis in Finance at the University of Lausanne (HEC Lausanne).  
The thesis explores a hybrid portfolio optimization framework combining parametric and non-parametric techniques to better capture fat tails, skewness, and other non-normal features present in hedge fund returns.

## Project Summary

This repository contains the code and results developed for my Master's thesis on hedge fund portfolio optimization. The project introduces a semi-parametric optimization framework that blends the statistical rigor of parametric methods (e.g., GARCH models, EVT) with the flexibility of non-parametric techniques (e.g., kernel density estimation, copulas).
The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional models when applied to hedge fund returns, which often exhibit fat tails, skewness, and other non-normal features. The methodology is tested on over 30 years of HFR strategy index data and shows significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance across several downside risk metrics.

## Abstract

Hedge funds, with their complex investment strategies and distinct return distributions, pose significant challenges for traditional parametric portfolio optimization models. This research presents a semi-parametric approach to hedge fund portfolio optimization, to better capture the unconventional distributional characteristics of hedge fund returns. The semi-parametric methodology combines the strengths of both parametric and non-parametric approaches, addressing the limitations inherent in each. Traditional parametric models often fall short in capturing the higher moments and tail behaviors of hedge fund returns, while non-parametric methods, although flexible, can suffer from overfitting and computational inefficiency. We use hedge fund strategy indices from the HFR database to test our semi-parametric approach with
over 30 years of data. The findings reveal that the proposed model significantly improves risk-adjusted performance compared to traditional benchmarks, offering a robust framework for hedge fund portfolio optimization that aligns with real-world investment needs.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/gautierpetit/hedge-fund-portfolio-optimization.git 
   cd hedge-fund-portfolio-optimization
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Ensure the required data files are placed in the `/data/` folder as described in `/data/README.md`
4. Run the main script:
   main.py

All figures generated by the optimization scripts are saved to `/figures/`.  
Key summary plots are in the main folder, while additional diagnostic and component plots are in subfolders:
- `Correlation/` → S&P and bond correlation over time
- `Turnover/` → Portfolio turnover comparisons
- `Stackplots/` → Visual breakdown of evolving portfolio weights

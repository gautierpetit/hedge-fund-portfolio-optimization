# Figures Folder

This directory contains all visual outputs generated by the portfolio optimization process.

## Structure

- `/Correlation/`  
  Individual plots comparing constrained vs. unconstrained portfolio correlations to the S&P 500 and a bond index over time.

- `/Turnover/`  
  Individual plots comparing constrained vs. unconstrained portfolio turnover metrics over time.

- `/Stackplots/`  
  Stacked area charts showing portfolio weight evolution by strategy for each scenario.

- Root folder (`/figures/`)  
  Summary plots used directly in the thesis to compare key performance measures across models.

> All plots are automatically generated when running `main.py`.
